<p>This playlist contains songs that I had on repeat around November 13th, 2022 (hence the title). As you'll see on this page, tracking my listening on this date is a common occurence, because what better time is there to track your listening than your own birthday? Sometimes I look back on this playlist and ask myself "is this when my music taste peaked?", because in my opinion this is the perfect balance of "rock" and rap, with quality examples from both genres. Rock is in quotes there because the playlist starts off with <em> Sunday </em> by The Cranberries and <em>Fade Into You</em> by Mazzy Star, which I would argue go against many definitions of "rock". Some songs that stick out to me on this playlist are <em> Geek U.S.A. </em> by The Smashing Pumpkins, with its genius drum work, <em> Hun43rd </em> by A$AP Rocky, one of my favorites by him, and <em> Wasting Time </em> by blink-182, a showcase of the bands raw sound before they reached the mainstream. <em>Hummer</em> by The Smashing Pumpkins is another masterpiece throughout, finishing off with a soothing outro that allows for a break from the "wall of fuzz" created by the guitars.

<p>Although I didn't track my listening through most of 2023, the <em>best of rock 2023</em> playlist on the rock page pretty much defines my soundtrack for most of that year, up until this point. At the beginning of my senior year in high school, my listening returned to that balance between rap and rock. Influences from the first 9 months or so of the year like The Smashing Pumpkins still found their way into this playlist, but new additions like <em>Codeine Crazy</em> and <em>March Madness</em> by Future, and <em>Swang</em> by Rae Sremmurd defined my new listening habits. As I'll state many times on this site, <em>Swang</em> is the greatest modern rap song of all time in my opinion. The synths weaving in and out of the mix as they build up, and then doing it all again, create a floating type of feeling that's hard to match. The track sounds way ahead of it's time but can easily bring that nostalgic feel. The highlight of this song for me is the synth's chord progression and build up from 1:08 to 1:22 of the track. An ethereal, hollow sound creates a distant void allowing the vocals to shine, only to snap back to an octave higher and release that pent-up energy. Truly a masterpiece.

<p> As you can see, this playlist is heavily one-sided towards rap and not as balanced as the previous year. Although most of the music in this playlist lacks the complexity of instrument-based music, a well-produced rap song can evoke that same feeling as a well-performed rock song for me. The playlist also reflects daily-life at the time, near the beginning of a fun and unserious senior year of high school. Some songs that stick out to me on this playlist are <em>Swang</em> by Rae Sremmurd, which holds the top spot in my favorite rap songs of all time, <em>Serve The Servants</em> by Nirvana, with it's sort of "bored" sound, <em>Too Much Sauce</em> by Future and Lil Uzi Vert, which holds my first memory of listening to these artists in 2016, and stuck with me all these years, and <em>Famous</em> by Kanye West, featuring a genius sample flip in the second half's instrumental.   </p>

           <p> For this playlist, I wanted to track my listening going into the new year. <em>Swang</em> at #1 again is just one example of how much I praise this song. Although this playlist is predominantly rap as again, there's a few appearances of electronic/house music (<em>Voyager</em> by Daft Punk, <em>Lady-Hear Me Tonight</em> by Modjo) and dance music(<em>Stereo Love</em> by Edward Maya and Vika Jigulina, <em>Get Lucky</em> by Daft Punk, Pharell Williams and Nile Rodgers). <em>Voyager</em> is a perfect example of a disco/funk sound gone electric, and the thick, jumping bassline complementing the synth loop creates this spacy atmosphere that makes this song special. <em>Gummo</em> by 6ix9ine, although controversial, exemplifies the idea previously brought up that a well-produced song of any genre can match that feeling of a well-performed instrument-based song. Another sort of spacy atmosphere created by the synths with a menacing sounding hook created by the instrumental that somehow finds a way to complement, and in my opinion outshine the harsh vocals.

Nearly 5 months later, my listening became a bit more balanced, and the rap songs got replaced with more quality songs of the same genre, in my opinion. Around this time, learning Greek became on of my main priorities, and my preferred method of learning was through music. Although I primarily would listen to these songs to learn the language and around my family, they're also well-crafted and contain the use of instruments unique to the culture that drive the melody. <em>IGOR'S THEME</em>, my top "rap" track in 2024, a primarily instrumental track uses a copious amount of synths but the drums on this song are the highlight for me.  The album <em>IGOR</em>'s genre falls in a sort of grey area, and it's unique use of synths and drum patterns questions the title "rap". <em>RoboCop</em> by Kanye West steers away from the norms of "rap" too and samples an orchestra throughout the song, especially in the chorus. His creativity (and vulnerability at points) during this era served as a blueprint for artists to come, and that's what makes <em>808s & Heartbreak</em> my favorite Kanye album. See <em>Paranoid</em> by Kanye West as well.

<p> In the middle of the summer, I was still using Greek music as my method of learning the language and there's no better song to pick from than <em>Thimame</em> by Pantelis Pantelidis. Every piece of this song evokes emotion, and even if you don't understand the lyrics, the vocals have the power to send the message instead. House music and dance music, both classic and new, began to take over my listening in the summer, including <em>L'Amour Toujours</em> by Gigi D'Agostino and <em>Mr. Saxobeat</em> by Alexandra Stan. Considering that I was the one to be given the privilege to connect to the speakers at mostly every party, it makes sense. One song that stands out in this playlist is <em>Don't Stop</em> by ATB, a classic EDM song that I know thanks to my dad, who was a fan when the genre was emerging in the late 90s/early 2000s. This song does one of the best jobs in evoking positive emotions and fits perfect in a summer atmosphere.

<p>In late October, my listening habits were all over the place, but each song holds meaning. <em>Freestyle 2</em> by Ken Carson was a song that I was always familiar with, but it found a way to resonate with me at this time. Although lacking structure, it makes up for it by not having a repetitive nature, all while Ken Carson maintains his flow on this intense, distorted instrumental. This song allowed me to open my eyes to his music, leading into the song that took the top spot, <em>Succubus</em>. This song includes the structure that <em>Freestyle 2</em> was lacking, which allows for the hypnotic melody of the verses to perform on yet another heavy instrumental. This song brings a sort of dark energy that's captured by the layers of eerie synths and their progression, all coming together to form this beautiful, yet haunting track. I don't have any explanation, but more than a few songs on this playlist carry that same eerie vibe as a result of the intrumentals and/or vocal progressions. These include <em>Last Night</em> by Diddy featuring Keyshia Cole, <em>through the late night</em> by Travis Scott and Kid Cudi, and <em>As The Rush Comes</em> by Motorcycle.</p>

<p> Some time in-between this playlist and the last one, I was reminded of how perfect a song <em>Simple Man</em> by Lynyrd Skynyrd is. My dad would often play me this song due to the message in the lyrics, but being how I am, I got lost in the instrumental. One of the most important values of any art form is its ability is to draw emotion, and the bass during the intro certainly does that for me. Additionally, the three guitars and the technicality of the bassline during the verses adds layers on layers to evolve the song into something special. During the guitar solo, the bass is also prominent in the mix, in the form of chords this time. Another song that stands out on this playlist is <em>Get Lit</em> by A$AP Rocky, featuring Fat Tony. If there was one song that defined A$AP Rocky's early sound it would be this one. The signature spacy feel of his early cloud rap days, further enhanced by the genius sample flip of the subway braking noise makes me question why this song isn't more recognized by his fans.
